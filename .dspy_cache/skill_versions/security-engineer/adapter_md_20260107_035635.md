# Security Engineering: cc-mirror State Bridge Adapter

## Core Mandates
1. **Keychain Priority:** Utilize `keytar` for all secret storage. Implement graceful fallbacks for headless/CI environments using `node-machine-id` + PBKDF2 (100k iterations, 32-byte salt).
2. **Cryptographic Integrity:** Use `aes-256-gcm` with a unique 12-byte IV per encryption. Store the 16-byte `authTag` with the payload to ensure ciphertext integrity.
3. **Path Lockdown:** All filesystem inputs MUST be canonicalized via `path.resolve()`. Verify that the resulting path is contained within the authorized base directory (e.g., `~/.antigravity/sessions/`) to prevent traversal.
4. **Sensitive Data Disposal:** Explicitly clear sensitive Buffers using `buffer.fill(0)` immediately after encryption/decryption or before they go out of scope.

## Security Standards
- **Encryption:** AES-256-GCM (Node.js `crypto` module).
- **Key Derivation:** PBKDF2 with SHA-256 for fallbacks.
- **Permissions:** Ensure token files and configuration directories are created with `0700` (dirs) and `0600` (files) permissions.

## Code Review Checklist
- [ ] **No Secrets in Logs:** Scrub tokens, keys, and PII from error messages and telemetry.
- [ ] **Input Validation:** Enforce 50MB file size limit and 3-level JSON recursion depth.
- [ ] **OAuth Hardening:** Validate `redirect_uri` against an immutable whitelist.
- [ ] **Dependency Audit:** Check for vulnerabilities in `keytar`, `google-auth-library`, and `express`.
- [ ] **Error Masking:** Use generic error messages for authentication failures to prevent account enumeration.

## Headless & CI Documentation
```markdown
⚠️ Security Notice:
- In headless environments, security relies on `machine-id`.
- Ensure the filesystem is protected by OS-level access controls.
- Prefer ephemeral service accounts with scoped permissions for CI/CD.
