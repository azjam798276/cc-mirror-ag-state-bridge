 ## Core Mandates
-1. **Keychain First:** Always try OS keychain before machine-id fallback.
-2. **No Plaintext:** Tokens never stored unencrypted on disk.
-3. **Validate Paths:** Prevent directory traversal attacks.
+1. **Keychain Priority:** Utilize `keytar` for all secret storage. Implement graceful fallbacks for headless/CI environments using `node-machine-id` + PBKDF2 (100k iterations, 32-byte salt).
+2. **Cryptographic Integrity:** Use `aes-256-gcm` with a unique 12-byte IV per encryption. Store the 16-byte `authTag` with the payload to ensure ciphertext integrity.
+3. **Path Lockdown:** All filesystem inputs MUST be canonicalized via `path.resolve()`. Verify that the resulting path is contained within the authorized base directory (e.g., `~/.antigravity/sessions/`) to prevent traversal.
+4. **Sensitive Data Disposal:** Explicitly clear sensitive Buffers using `buffer.fill(0)` immediately after encryption/decryption or before they go out of scope.
 
 ## Security Standards
-- **Encryption:** AES-256-GCM with random IV per token
-- **Key Storage:** OS keychain (`keytar` library)
-- **Fallback:** Machine-ID + PBKDF2 (100K iterations)
+- **Encryption:** AES-256-GCM (Node.js `crypto` module).
+- **Key Derivation:** PBKDF2 with SHA-256 for fallbacks.
+- **Permissions:** Ensure token files and configuration directories are created with `0700` (dirs) and `0600` (files) permissions.
 
 ## Code Review Checklist
-- [ ] No secrets in logs or error messages
-- [ ] Path inputs canonicalized
-- [ ] File size validated before read
-- [ ] JSON depth limited
-- [ ] OAuth redirect URI validated
+- [ ] **No Secrets in Logs:** Scrub tokens, keys, and PII from error messages and telemetry.
+- [ ] **Input Validation:** Enforce 50MB file size limit and 3-level JSON recursion depth.
+- [ ] **OAuth Hardening:** Validate `redirect_uri` against an immutable whitelist.
+- [ ] **Dependency Audit:** Check for vulnerabilities in `keytar`, `google-auth-library`, and `express`.
+- [ ] **Error Masking:** Use generic error messages for authentication failures to prevent account enumeration.
 
-## Headless Documentation Required
+## Headless & CI Documentation
 ```markdown
-⚠️ Security Warning for Headless Servers:
-- Keys derived from machine ID
-- Tokens portable if filesystem accessed
-- Use service accounts with minimal permissions
-```
+⚠️ Security Notice:
+- In headless environments, security relies on `machine-id`.
+- Ensure the filesystem is protected by OS-level access controls.
+- Prefer ephemeral service accounts with scoped permissions for CI/CD.
